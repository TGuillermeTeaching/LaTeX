\section{Additional cool equations}
%basically treat this the same as normal chapters
\label{sec:root-state-calc}
 
This probability is given by the likelihood given that the root is in state
$i$ divided by the sum of the likelihoods over both root states,
$D_{Ri}/(D_{R0}+D_{R1})$.  The overall likelihood is then:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:root}
  D_{R} = D_{R0}\frac{D_{R0}}{D_{R0} + D_{R1}} +
  D_{R1}\frac{D_{R1}}{D_{R0} + D_{R1}}
\end{equation}
